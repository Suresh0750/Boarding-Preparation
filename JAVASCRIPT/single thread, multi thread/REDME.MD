Single-Threaded
    JavaScript is primarily single-threaded. This means that it has a single call stack, which is responsible for executing one task at a time. The single-threaded nature is particularly evident in the browser's JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome), where all JavaScript code is run on the main thread.

Key Characteristics:

    Sequential Execution: JavaScript code is executed line by line in the order it is written.

    Blocking: If a task takes a long time to complete (e.g., a network request or a heavy computation), 
    it can block the main thread, making the UI unresponsive.

    Event Loop: To handle asynchronous operations (like callbacks, promises, and async/await), 
                JavaScript uses an event loop. This allows it to perform non-blocking operations even within a single-threaded environment.


Multi-Threaded

    Though JavaScript is single-threaded by nature, it can utilize additional threads through Web Workers or Worker Threads in Node.js. These allow you to run scripts in background threads, parallel to the main thread.

Key Characteristics:

    Concurrency: Web Workers enable JavaScript to run multiple operations concurrently without blocking the main thread.

    Communication: Workers communicate with the main thread via messages (using the postMessage and onmessage methods). Data passed between threads is usually copied rather than shared directly to avoid issues like race conditions.

    No Shared State: Web Workers do not share variables or objects with the main thread directly, which prevents many common concurrency issues but also means that shared data has to be explicitly passed between threads.
