1. Cookies:
    Created by: Websites
    
    Purpose: Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing. They are created by websites and can be used to store information about the user, such as login sessions, preferences, tracking information, and other details specific to a user. For example, cookies can remember your login state on a website, so you don't have to log in again every time you visit.
    Scope: Cookies are typically domain-specific (e.g., a cookie set by example.com is only accessible by example.com). They can have expiration dates, after which they are automatically deleted.

2. Cache:

Created by: Web Browsers (and sometimes by websites via HTTP headers)

    Purpose: Cache is a mechanism used by web browsers to store copies of resources (such as images, HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, etc.) locally on a user's computer. The primary purpose of caching is to improve website loading times and reduce server load by storing frequently accessed resources locally so they don't have to be re-downloaded every time the user visits the website.
    
    Scope: Cache is typically managed by the browser itself, and it is used to store content temporarily. It can be specific to a session or persisted longer based on caching rules set by the website (e.g., via cache-control headers).
