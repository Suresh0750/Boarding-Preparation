## CRUD

    The basic methods of interacting with a MongoDB server are called CRUD operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These CRUD methods are the primary ways you will manage the data in your databases.

## aggregation & pipeline

    Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. The stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline.
